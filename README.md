## Overview

This an exercise from the Git and Github Bootcamp course I'm taking through Udemy. The course is instructed by Colt Steele. This is an exercise (lessons #149-#151) from Section 16.

### The challenge

This exercise is to implement the basics of using the git interactive rebase command and take this commit history and use interactive rebase to clean things up.  

The initial commit log:

```
2029e20 my cat made this commit
655204d fix another navbar typo
2a45e71 fix navbar typos
4ff2290 add top navbar
6e39a76 whoops forgot to add bootstrap js script
240827f add bootstrap
519aab6 add basic HTML boilerplate
cbee26b I added project files
0e19c7a initial commit
```
The end goal:

```
b8f8889 add top navbar
64fa7d4 add bootstrap
4273423 add basic HTML boilerplate
0ffb0aa add project files
0e19c7a initial commit
```

### Built with

- Using VSCode
- BASH Terminal

### What I learned

- Rewording commits through interactive rebase and cleaning up messy commits.

### Continued development

There are 20 sections to this course, each with a number of lessons and exercises. This is the an exercise from Section 16. There are previous exercises that I will be posting, as well as exercises that I have done since this one which I will also add. I am more than halfway through this course at this time and not every section has an exercise that could be, or needs to be added to a repository. I will add those exercises that are relevant as it will help solidify my understanding and better develop my skill through practice.
